# Multi-Sig Project Management Tool

## Project Title
**Multi-Sig Project Management Tool: Milestone-Based Payment System**

## Project Description
The Multi-Sig Project Management Tool is a decentralized smart contract built on the Soroban platform that revolutionizes how projects handle milestone-based payments. This system requires multiple stakeholder approvals before releasing payments, ensuring transparency, accountability, and mutual agreement among all parties involved. Each project milestone is tracked with detailed information including payment amounts, approval status, and stakeholder consensus, creating a trustless environment for project execution and payment distribution.

The smart contract eliminates the need for intermediaries by automating the approval process and payment release mechanism, reducing disputes and increasing trust between project stakeholders, clients, and contractors.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to transform traditional project management and payment systems by introducing a blockchain-based multi-signature approval mechanism. We aim to create a fair, transparent, and secure ecosystem where:

- **Trust is Built-In**: All stakeholders have equal visibility and control over milestone approvals
- **Payments are Protected**: Funds are released only when consensus is reached among authorized parties
- **Disputes are Minimized**: Clear milestone definitions and transparent approval processes reduce conflicts
- **Efficiency is Maximized**: Automated smart contract execution eliminates manual payment processing delays

By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a future where project collaborations are seamless, payments are secure, and all parties operate with complete confidence in the system's integrity.

## Key Features

- **Milestone Creation**: Create project milestones with detailed descriptions and specified payment amounts
- **Multi-Signature Approval**: Configurable number of required approvals before payment release
- **Approval Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of approval progress for each milestone
- **Automatic Payment Release**: Payments are automatically marked as released when approval threshold is met
- **Immutable Records**: All milestone data and approvals are permanently recorded on the blockchain
- **Timestamp Verification**: Blockchain-based timestamp for each milestone creation
- **Transparent Status**: Easy verification of milestone status, approvals received, and payment release status
- **Flexible Approval Requirements**: Each milestone can have different approval requirements based on project needs
- **Data Persistence**: Extended TTL ensures long-term availability of project data

## Future Scope

1. **Token Integration**: Integrate with Stellar tokens (XLM or custom tokens) for actual on-chain payment transfers upon milestone approval

2. **Stakeholder Management**: Implement a whitelist system to register authorized stakeholders with specific voting rights and roles (client, contractor, project manager, auditor)

3. **Weighted Voting**: Add support for weighted approval systems where different stakeholders have different voting powers

4. **Revocation Mechanism**: Allow stakeholders to revoke their approvals before the threshold is met

5. **Escrow Functionality**: Implement smart contract escrow to lock funds at milestone creation and automatically release upon approval

6. **Dispute Resolution**: Add a built-in arbitration mechanism for handling disputes with third-party mediators

7. **Milestone Dependencies**: Create dependency chains where certain milestones must be completed before others can be started

8. **Partial Payments**: Support for releasing partial payments based on percentage of work completed

9. **Time-Based Controls**: Add deadline tracking, automatic expiration, and time-locked payments

10. **Advanced Analytics**: Dashboard showing project progress, payment history, approval patterns, and stakeholder participation rates

11. **Multi-Project Support**: Extend to manage multiple projects simultaneously with project-specific stakeholder groups

12. **Notification System**: Integrate event emissions for real-time notifications when approvals are submitted or milestones are released

13. **Document Attachment**: Add IPFS integration to attach project documents, deliverables, and proof of work to milestones

14. **Budget Management**: Implement overall project budget tracking with milestone allocation and remaining balance calculations

15. **Reputation System**: Build a reputation score for stakeholders based on their approval patterns and project completion rates
